# Running the Application

## Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Navigate to `src/frontend/src` to install dependencies and run the front end.

### Dependencies

For the frontend [npm (Node)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) is the only dependency, all further entities used are collected with npm. 

### Installing

`npm i` to install Node dependencies.

### Available Scripts

In the frontend src directory, you can run:

#### `npm start` | `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
